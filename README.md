# leap-simple

Simpler examples of using the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) device.

This thing is amazing and will make you feel like an old fogey for liking
those rolling clickers, but the mega-examples scare me. This reduces them
to little understandable chunks of code.

Examples use just a hint of [d3js](http://d3js.org/), none of the hard
parts.
